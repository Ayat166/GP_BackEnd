## About the Project

In the realm of e-commerce, the inability to try on clothes before purchasing poses a significant challenge. VProva addresses this issue by providing a virtual fitting room experience, allowing users to see how clothes would fit and look on them through their mobile devices. This not only enhances user satisfaction but also reduces return rates for online retailers.

## Features

- **Virtual Try-On:** Users can upload their images and virtually try on different outfits.
- **AI-Powered Fitting:** Utilizes the IDM_VTON generative AI model to accurately overlay clothing on user images.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design ensures a seamless user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various mobile devices to ensure accessibility.

## Architecture

The application is structured into two main components:

1. **Frontend (Mobile Application):**
   - Built using Flutter.
   - Handles user interactions, image uploads, and displays the virtual try-on results.

2. **Backend:**
   - Developed with Django REST Framework.
   - Manages API endpoints, user authentication, and communication with the AI model.
   - Processes images and returns the generated try-on results.


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - Flutter

- **Backend:**
  - Python
  - Django REST Framework
  - PostgreSQL

- **AI Model:**
  - IDM_VTON

- **Others:**
  - Docker
  - Git & GitHub for version control
